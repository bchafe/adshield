so basically I have to completely revamp this program because I made the
assumption that I could source an external file in the hosts file, which
I can't. I thought my idea was clever, but I guess that's why no one
else has done it yet. so basically, the program will work like this:


-the program will query the patched hosts file and compare it to /etc/hosts

-on the first run or if there's an update, the program will detect the
difference and save the current hosts file as hosts.d/hosts.old

-then the hosts.old will be copied to the hosts file, and appended with
a warning message that changes to this file will be lost after updating,
and then the internet patched file, downloaded in hosts.d/patch.

-to check for updates, the script will compare the hosts.d/patch file to
the internet patched file, and if they differ then it will update the patch
file, and append the hosts.old


features:

-makes keeping your patched hosts file up to date as easy as running a script.

-easily change the location, file names, hosts file to download, etc. from a
config located by default at ~/.adshieldrc

-downloading the .adshieldrc from the internet to simplify installation










future ideas:

-somehow implementing an outside file, or some means to make adding or removing
addresses to be blocked easier than going straight to the hosts file, also to
make changes persistent without having to add them in the hosts.old
